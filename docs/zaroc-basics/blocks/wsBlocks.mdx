WhatsApp Blocks help us to display Information on WhatsApp

Whatsapp Environment has big differences and its blocks depend of what partner you have.
Whatspp blocks works differently as another blocks, due whatsapp complexity we had just 2 ways of sending whatsapp components with its own explanation.

### wsButton

> - Button block is every component that uses buttons, you can use image, text, files, videos on header.
> - button can contain postback text as customButton, we can't have links due we need to create a whatsapp template (Costs Depend of the region).
> - We can have up to 3 buttons, if we add more than 3 we will receive an error from whatsapp that wont populate on the chatbot.
