There are many ways to integrate our chatbot with Facebook Messenger, I recomend you to Try a native connection between Dialogflow + Facebook, you can check that [**HERE**](https://google.com)

If you got the connection successfull I encourage you to check Zaroc Doc, Try the tutorials and lets go with some Fb Templates.

After that, when being in control of this part of DF and FM, check some provider or try to revalidate your business with Facebook in order to use the external Structures.

### Steps

> - Create your bot (you dont need to create an amazing bot, you only need to have it created like the default bot)
> - Access Facebook Developers and create an app (the name of this app can be the name o your bot)
> - This app will be another app, go to messages permissions and select only **Messages input** and **Messages output**
> - Go to Dialogflow Integration tab and click on Facebook, here you will need to type a prefered password
> - On Facebook Developers, go to webhook tab, then link a page.
> - Then in webhook tag start the webhook integration, copy the webhook url that facebook provides and paste the password you typed on dialogflow

## WhatsApp Integration (WhatsApp Cloud API)

:::tip Keep in Mind

WhatsApp has a hard environment (and deployment) cause of **high prices to use API**, at the first time I recommend you to use simple Apps that can help us to connect WhatsApp with Dialogflow only for Text.

AutoResponder (APK) can help you to make this connection.

Currently you can use a Paragraph Block that is avaiable for Zaroc right now, in addition you can get Parameters, values from the Request, use fallbacks and implement contexts. With these tools you can create an Amazing bot in the meantime.

:::

For direct Whatsapp API

### Requirements

> - Meta Account Verified
> - Meta Business Account Verified
> - Meta Facebook Developers Account
> - SimCard (Once you use a number for a Chatbot youll lose the ability to use on your phone for common messaging)

### Steps

> - Current on BETA
