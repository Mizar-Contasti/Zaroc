# webTemplates

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

WebTemplates are used to build nice structures in a Web Environment. These templates are created to work with Dialogflow Messenger.

## webStructureTemplate

**webStructureTemplate help us to create a custom Structure**

> - You can use whatever block you want but take in mind that you have to separate it with a separator (Choose what best fits to you).
> - In order to make structure work, you can paste all the name's structures inside of structure, and the components required in the component array
> - If you dont know already what to do with context please make it false and just declare contextBody as nothing. (You can find Context in doc)
> - Available webBlocks are **card button reply description image list paragraph** These can be located in blocks -> webBlocks
> - Available separators are **comma basicDivider commaDivider superDivider**

> - You can build a structure with the blocks or use this Structure Template Tool [**HERE**](https://github.com/)
