# wsTemplates (BETA)

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

wsTemplates are used to build nice structures in a WhatsApp Environment. These templates are created to work with WhatsApp.

### wsParagraphTemplate

**wsStructureTemplate help us to create a custom Structure**

> - You can use whatever block you want but take in mind that you have to separate it with a separator (Choose what best fits to you).
> - In order to make structure work, you can paste all the name's structures inside of structure, and the components required in the component array
> - If you dont know already what to do with context please make it false and just declare contextBody as nothing. (You can find Context in doc)
> - wsBlocks are just 2 ( **button** / **list** ), check ws blocks to understand how they work.
