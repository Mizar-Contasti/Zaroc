# wsTemplates

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

wsTemplates are used to build nice structures in a WhatsApp Environment. These templates are created to work with WhatsApp.

### wsParagraphTemplate

**wsStructureTemplate help us to create a custom Structure**

> - You can use whatever block you want but take in mind that you have to separate it with a separator (Choose what best fits to you).
> - In order to make structure work, you can paste all the name's structures inside of structure, and the components required in the component array
> - If you dont know already what to do with session please make it false and just declare session as empty array. (You can find Context in doc).
> - wsBlocks are just 2 ( **button** / **list** ), check ws blocks to understand how they work.

<TabItem value="php" label="PHP">

```php
$session = [];

$wsHeaderType = ["image"];
$wsHeaderContent = ["https://picsum.photos/500"];
$wsBodyContent = ["body text"];
$wsFooterContent = ["footer text"];
$wsButtonTitleArray = ["button1", "button2"];
$wsButtonCustomArray = ["button1", "button2"];

$structure = [
                'button',
            ];

$components = [
                [$wsHeaderType, $wsHeaderContent, $wsBodyContent, $wsFooterContent, $wsButtonTitleArray, $wsButtonCustomArray],
