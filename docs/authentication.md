Let's discover **how Zaroc help us with Chatbot Backends**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **Creating our chatbot Throught Dialogflow and Connecting to Zaroc**.

Or **Look at this Tutorial** with **[Mizar](youtubevideo)**.

## Create a Chatbot on Dialogflow

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
