# Chatbots

Let's discover **Chatbots that are Currently Built with Zaroc**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://zaroc.netlify.app)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `https://zaroc.netlify.app`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
