# Authentication

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

Let's discover **How to Authenticate Dialogflow with Zaroc**.

Authentication is a common process on all the Applications, for Chatbots or Webhooks isnt an exception.

Authentication gives us multiple benefits

> - Gives us security layer, so noone more than us can access to our webhook.
> - Gives security to the owner of the chatbot.

#### How Authentication works?

When Dialoglow sends a Request to our webhook, our webhook checks the headers.

We catch headers user/password (for example) and compare with the user/password that we declared on our webhook side. If the parameters are not equal, our webhook will send an Error message and close the connection/port.

If the Authentication goes fine, we check the requests, goes to especific intents...

#### Variables used for Authentication

Currently we are using a basic and strong Authentication.

As you see in our Core Chatbot file there is a function called **auth** which received 2 parameters, a name and a password, these variables are declared inside of the variables file that is inside of our chatbot.

So first lets check these variables, choose the name and password that best fits to you.

#### Checking on Dialogflow the Variables

After setting the name/password we are expecting from our Chatbot/Webhook lets go to Dialogflow, especifically in Fulfillment, right there you will see your webhook enabled and some fields named as **Basic Auth**.

With that you should be able to Authenticate successfully. Hope this helps you a lot.

There are other methods for Authenticate in Future but there are Alpha by the time.
